image: ./event.png
description: When you synchronize things, you make happen at the same time. If you have rhythm, you can synchronize your dance moves with the beat of the music. Synchronize with your partner without looking them. A screen would separate the participants.

rules: 
- Each team should consist of an even number of members (up to 6). 
- Time allowed is 8-10 min. 
- Any style of dance is allowed. 
- Mirror imaging of step is not allowed (participants are expected to perform identical step and  not the mirror image of one's image.) 
- Judgement will be based on for synchronisation, choreography, creativity, expression, costume,  and makeup and overall effects. 
- Theme will not be a judgement criterion. 
- Teams must hand over their music in mp3 format to the event coordinator prior to the  composition. 
- Online and offline registrations are allowed. 
- The decision of judges will be final.
