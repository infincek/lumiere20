- Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics; robots without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.
- If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organisers. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organisers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.
